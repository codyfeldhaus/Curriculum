# Working in Large Codebases and Collaboration with Git

## Tuesday - In-Depth Conceptual Overview

### Understanding Large Codebases

#### Strategies for Reading and Understanding Existing Code
- **Start with High-Level Documentation**: Begin by reading architecture documents or high-level overviews to understand the system's purpose and design.
- **Codebase Tour**: If available, go through a codebase tour or onboarding session provided by your team.
- **Use Code Navigation Tools**: Utilize IDEs and tools like 'sourcegraph' for better code navigation and understanding dependencies.

#### Tips for Navigating Large Projects
- **Understanding Directory Structure**: Familiarize yourself with common structures like MVC (Model-View-Controller) or modular patterns.
- **Entrypoint Analysis**: Identify the application's entry points, such as the main method or primary route handlers.
- **Commit History and Blame Tool**: Use `git blame` and the commit history to understand why certain changes were made.

### Git Collaboration Techniques

#### Advanced Git Workflows
- **Feature Branch Workflow**: Work on features in isolated branches, merging back into the main branch upon completion.
- **Git Rebase for Clean History**: Use `git rebase` for linear history and easier code review.
- **Release Branches**: Manage releases through dedicated branches to stabilize the release while continuing development on the main branch.

#### Managing Merge Conflicts and Code Reviews
- **Regular Rebasing**: Regularly rebase feature branches against the main branch to reduce merge conflicts.
- **Conflict Resolution Best Practices**: Communicate with team members involved in the conflicting changes to find the best resolution.
- **Constructive Code Reviews**: Focus on constructive feedback, style consistency, and catching bugs.

### Best Practices for Collaboration

#### Coding Standards and Documentation
- **Adhere to Style Guides**: Follow language-specific style guides (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, Google Java Style Guide).
- **In-Code Documentation**: Use comments and documentation blocks judiciously to explain why the code is written a certain way.
- **Automated Documentation Tools**: Leverage tools like Javadoc or Doxygen for maintaining up-to-date documentation.

#### Communication in Team Environments
- **Clear and Concise Commit Messages**: Follow conventions like Conventional Commits for structured and readable commit messages.
- **Regular Stand-ups and Updates**: Participate in daily stand-ups or regular team meetings to stay aligned with the team's goals and challenges.
- **Use of Project Management Tools**: Utilize tools like JIRA, Trello, or Asana for tracking tasks and progress.

### Additional Industry Standards
- **Code Linting and Formatting Tools**: Use tools like ESLint for JavaScript or Black for Python to maintain code quality and consistency.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Integrate CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment processes.
- **Peer Programming**: Engage in pair or mob programming sessions for complex features or to onboard new team members.

## Week's Objective
The focus this week is on developing a deep understanding and practical skills in navigating large codebases and collaborating effectively using Git. Emphasis will be on industry best practices, advanced Git techniques, and clear communication within team settings.
