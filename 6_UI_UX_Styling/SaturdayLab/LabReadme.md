# Health and Wellness App Lab

## Objective
Develop a Health and Wellness App focusing on daily wellness activities and tips.

## Lab Steps

### Step 1: Project Setup
- Initialize a new React project using `create-react-app`.
- Install and set up Mantine-UI for styling.

### Step 2: Define Features and Layout
- Decide on the key features: Daily Activity Log, Wellness Tips, and Resource Recommendations.
- Create a basic wireframe or layout for your app's UI.

### Step 3: Component Creation
- Create the following components:
  - `Header`: A top navigation/header component.
  - `ActivityLog`: A component to log daily wellness activities.
  - `TipOfTheDay`: A component to display a daily wellness tip.
  - `ResourceRecommendations`: A component to list recommended wellness resources.

### Step 4: Implementing the Header
- Develop the `Header` component with navigation links to each main feature section.
- Style the `Header` for visual appeal and clarity.

### Step 5: Building the Activity Log
- In `ActivityLog`, allow users to add and view their daily activities.
- Implement form inputs for activity type, duration, and optional notes.

### Step 6: Daily Wellness Tip
- Develop `TipOfTheDay` to display a random wellness tip from a predefined list.
- Include a button to show a new tip.

### Step 7: Resource Recommendations
- In `ResourceRecommendations`, display a list of helpful wellness resources or links.
- Use cards or list items for each resource.

### Step 8: Responsive Design
- Ensure your app is responsive. Test on different devices using Mantine-UI's responsive utilities.

### Step 9: Adding Interactivity
- Implement interactive features, such as updating the daily tip or adding a new activity.

### Step 10: Finalizing and Testing
- Review and refine the UI/UX of the app.
- Perform basic functionality tests to ensure everything works as expected.

### Step 11: Feedback and Iteration
- If possible, gather feedback on the UI/UX from peers or mentors.
- Make iterative improvements based on the feedback.

## Deliverables
- A functional Health and Wellness App with the specified features.
- A brief presentation explaining your design decisions and any challenges encountered.

## Note
This lab project aims to balance creativity with structured learning, allowing you to apply UI/UX principles in a focused manner.
