# **Project 1: Hangman**

In your first project, you will build your very own version of a classic word-guessing game: Hangman. By utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you'll not only create an attractive user interface but also enhance your problem-solving and coding skills. This project serves as an excellent opportunity to showcase your abilities while delivering an interactive Hangman game that can be a valuable addition to your portfolio.

## **Project Requirements:**

1. **User Interface (HTML & CSS):**
   - Craft a visually pleasing and responsive user interface for the Hangman game.
   - Design a layout encompassing key elements: the Hangman illustration, the concealed word (initially represented as underscores), a list of guessed letters, and the hangman's limbs (initially hidden).
   - Apply CSS styles to ensure readability and user-friendliness.
   - Ensure adaptability of the game layout across various screen sizes, from desktop to mobile devices.

2. **Game Logic (JavaScript):**
   - Implement the core game logic using JavaScript:
     - Randomly select a word from a predefined list for players to guess.
     - Display the word as a series of underscores at the beginning.
     - Enable players to input a letter guess.
     - Validate guesses to confirm they are single letters and have not been guessed before.
     - Update the game state based on the guess:
       - Reveal correctly guessed letters within the word.
       - Show the hangman's limbs for incorrect guesses (up to a maximum of 6 incorrect guesses).
       - Conclude the game when the word is guessed correctly or the hangman is fully displayed (game over).
   - Keep track of the player's score, including counts of correct and incorrect guesses.

3. **Gameplay:**
   - Implement user interactions for seamless gameplay:
     - Allow players to click or type a letter for their guess.
     - Provide immediate feedback on the accuracy of guesses.
     - Display relevant messages upon winning or losing the game.
     - Enable players to start a new game after completing or losing the current one.

4. **Additional Features (Optional):**
   - Consider enhancing the user experience with optional features like a timer, sound effects, or a word hint.
   - Provide options for players to customize the word list or choose different difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard).

5. **Code Quality:**
   - Write clean, well-structured, and organized code.
   - Utilize meaningful variable and function names for clarity.
   - Implement error handling and validation to prevent unexpected behavior.

6. **Documentation:**
   - Include clear and concise comments throughout your code to elucidate your implementation.
   - Create a README.md file containing instructions for playing the game and any supplementary project information.

7. **Testing:**
   - Rigorously test your Hangman game to ensure correct functionality and robust handling of various scenarios.

8. **Presentation:**
   - Prepare a brief presentation or demo to effectively showcase your Hangman game to your class or instructor.

By successfully completing this project, you'll not only enhance your proficiency in front-end web development and JavaScript programming but also create an enjoyable and interactive game.
