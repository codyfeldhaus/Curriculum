**Project 4: Full Stack Project**

In this pivotal fourth project, you'll take a significant step in your web development journey by building a comprehensive full-stack application that integrates front-end, back-end, and database functionalities. The primary objective is to demonstrate your proficiency in creating a functional web application, prioritizing core functionality over intricate front-end design. This project serves as a culmination of your skills and knowledge, highlighting your ability to orchestrate the full development stack. Your task is to create a robust and functional application that showcases your capabilities in both front-end and back-end development, coupled with database management.

**Project Requirements:**

1. **Front-End Development:**
   - Design a straightforward and responsive user interface for your full-stack application. While aesthetics are important, prioritize functionality over intricate design.
   - Create the necessary user interface components and layouts using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or a front-end library or framework of your choice (e.g., React, Angular, or Vue.js).
   - Implement user interactions and features that facilitate the core functionality of your application.

2. **Back-End Development:**
   - Develop a back-end server using a server-side technology or framework (e.g., Node.js with Express, Python with Flask, Ruby on Rails, etc.).
   - Implement RESTful or GraphQL API endpoints to handle incoming requests from the front end.
   - Set up routing, request handling, and error handling on the server.

3. **Database Integration:**
   - Integrate a database system of your choice (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB) into your project.
   - Design and create the necessary database tables or collections to store and retrieve data relevant to your application's functionality.
   - Implement data retrieval, storage, and manipulation operations within your server-side code.

4. **Authentication and Authorization:**
   - Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms as needed based on your application's functionality.
   - Ensure secure access control based on user roles and permissions.

5. **Core Functionality:**
   - Focus on delivering the core functionality of your application. This could be a task manager, a note-taking app, a simple e-commerce platform, or any other project that showcases your full-stack skills.
   - Ensure that the core features are robust, well-tested, and fully functional.

6. **Testing:**
   - Conduct thorough testing of your application, including unit tests for back-end functionality and integration tests for the full-stack interactions.
   - Test for edge cases, error handling, and data validation.

7. **Documentation:**
   - Maintain clear and well-organized documentation that includes the project's objectives, technical specifications, database schema, API endpoints, and any other relevant project information.

8. **Presentation:**
   - Prepare a presentation or demonstration to showcase your full-stack project to your class or instructor.
   - Explain the project's core functionality, technical challenges, and lessons learned during development.

By successfully completing this full-stack project, you'll demonstrate your ability to bring together front-end, back-end, and database functionalities to create a functional web application. Focus on delivering core functionality while ensuring robustness and proper documentation. This project represents a significant milestone in your web development journey and will contribute significantly to your portfolio of work!
