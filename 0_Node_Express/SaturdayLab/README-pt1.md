# Event Registration Website Lab Assignment

## Objective
Build an event registration website using Node.js, Express, and React. Implement a backend server for event data management and a React front-end for user interactions. Incorporate basic user authentication and organize code using middleware and routes folders.

## Setup and Structure

### Backend (`event-server`)
- **Structure**:
  - **Main File**: `index.js`
  - **Folders**: `routes`, `middleware`
  - **Data Store**: In-memory arrays for events and users.
    - Example structure for events data:
      ```javascript
      const events = [
        {
          id: 1,
          name: "Tech Conference 2023",
          description: "An annual conference for tech enthusiasts, featuring talks from industry leaders, workshops, and networking opportunities.",
          date: "2023-07-15",
          location: "Convention Center, Silicon Valley", 
          attendees: [1] // contains user IDs
        }
      ];
      ```
    - Example structure for users data:
      ```javascript
      const users = [
        { 
          userId: 1, 
          username: "bettycrocker", 
          password: "cake" 
        }
      ]
      ```
    You can make use of ChatGPT to generate more mock data for you by using these as templates. 

### Frontend (`event-client`)
- **React App**: Created using `create-react-app`.

## Instructions
Your first step should be to create a new Git repository that will contain both your client and server folders.

### Backend Setup
1. **Initialize Backend**:
   ```bash
   mkdir event-server
   cd event-server
   npm init -y
   npm install express jsonwebtoken
   ```

2. **Setup File Structure**:

  * Create `index.js` in the root.
  * Create `routes` and `middleware` folders.

3. **index.js**:
  
    * Setup Express and import `routes` and `middleware`.
      ```js
      const express = require('express');
      const app = express();
      app.use(express.json());
      // Import routes and middleware here

      const PORT = 3001;
      app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${PORT}`));
      ```

4. **Middleware**:

    * In `middleware`, create `authMiddleware.js`.
    * Implement JWT token authentication logic.

5. **Routes**:

    * In `routes`, create `eventsRoutes.js` and `usersRoutes.js`.
    * Implement event creation, registration, and viewing routes as well as user authentication and registration routes.
    * Authenticated users should be able to:
      1. Register for existing events
      2. Add new events
      3. See available events
    * Unauthenticated users should only be able to:
      1. See available events
    * Recommended Routes
      - Unprotected:
        1. Viewing Events: `/events`
        2. Logging In: `/login`
        3. New User Registration: `/new-user`
      - Protected:
        1. Adding a New Event: `/add-event`
        2. Registering for an Event: `/register`
    * Challenge Version:
      - Unprotected:
        1. Viewing Events: `/events`
        2. Logging In: `/users/login`
        3. New User Registration: `/users/registration`
      - Protected:
        1. Adding a New Event: `/events/add-event`
        2. Registering for an Event: `/events/register`
